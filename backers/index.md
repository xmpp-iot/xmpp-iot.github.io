# Manifest
By signing this page. We as an individual or organisation support:

- The open, interoperable and secure infrastructure made possible by the use of XMPP.
- The open standardization process for Internet of Things over XMPP.
- The globally scalable nature of federated XMPP networks to many billions of devices.
- Encryption of communication at all levels, including end-to-end encryption, as provided by XMPP.
- The possibility to provide globally unique identities to all devices using XMPP.
- The use of authentication, authorization and provisioning of access to devices and their data.
- Real-time communication with all types of devices at all times.
