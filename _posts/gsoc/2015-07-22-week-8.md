#Objective

#### Login and Contact Retrieval using Strophe for Mobile Application

##Abstract

Implementation of Mobile Application (Login, Roster and Presence).

##Work

* Tested Strophe Login using a hardcoded Script to connect to the BOSH Server with fixed Login Details.
* Made a View for Login to enter Username and Password.
* Problem : Login Form does not remove after Login is Successful.
* Contacts Retrieved are displayed as Jid under the login Form.

##Problems Faced and Bugs

* Bug : Login Form not removing.
* Presence only received for one Device (Solved) : Occupied with this problem for quiet some time. Realized later that Handler needs to return true, otherwise they work only once.

##Final Output
